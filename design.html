          <h4> The truth is, we discovered long ago that when used correctly, AI can make our lives easier, but in order to take advantage of this, we need to take a look at what Artificial Intelligence IS. </h4>

          <p id="med">
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence:  </strong>Artificial intelligence is the intelligence that a machine demonstrates unlike that of animals and humans. The machines are given jobs to do through programs created by humans to efficiently carry out actions that may be tedious for humans to sit through or quickly run through the data for businesses. What makes artificial intelligence so special is not only  regular computer programs is the machines’ ability to mimic human actions.

            <strong>Available Technology: </strong> Despite the immense potential AI proves to envision, the technology available currently only skims the surface of the ocean of possibility. The current use of AI is subtle, in systems such as speech recognition in smartphones with developing smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Samsung’s Bixby.

            In terms of the raw principles surrounding Artificial Intelligence, current technology revolves around to basic ideas: Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
            </br>
            <strong> Machine Learning: </strong>] Machine Learning currently exists as our most common form of AI application. Essentially what occurs in this process, is the use of basic AI principles such as learning and uncovering trends from large amounts of data. Think of a coin sorter, but one that sorts millions on trillions of coins, in mere minutes. </br>
            <strong> Neural Networks: </strong>From a biological perspective, neural networks make up the backbone of our understanding of how the brain works on a daily basis, through learning. AI development has allowed this biological idea to be recreated on a virtual level, in a sense, mimicking the animal brain’s processes and improving upon it to create virtual systems that can essentially think for themselves. The advancement of neural networks has been a keystone facet in the development of rudimentary AI applications through machine learning, and has also been integrated into more complex systems such as Google’s DeepMind AI. Deep learning and its accompaniments also fall under the subset of machine learning, and create computers and virtual systems that are ever closer to being “human”. 
          </p>
          <p> This brings up the question, how "human" is too "human"?</p>

            One of the main concerns related to augmented reality is privacy, which is also the cause of shutdown for many AR products. For example, the much hyped Google Glass was discontinued due to lingering concerns of recording private conversations. The fact that it had a camera, made it not only vulnerable to various security threats, but also a threat to others’ privacy. It only took one photo of a malicious QR code to make the entire device infected with a virus. The issue of privacy mainly stems for the fact that the augmented reality device is directly seeing what you can see, except it can record or and theoretically have a photographic memory. In addition, augmented reality devices can process the data from the cameras since it can connect to the internet. While all of this can have the potential to be used for good, there remains a chance of abuse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, another major concern regarding AR is that it can cause a distraction, as the device overlays information into your sight. For example, when driving part of your vision may be cut off, as a result of the data and visualization on on screen. While AR is a promising, one must take into the consideration of the many risks that come with it before using this technology.

          Google Glass is very similar to a pair of glasses, except it has an onboard processing unit with various different sensors paired with the Glass Operating System, and a mini projector to project information on the actual glass part of Google Glass. This projection is equivalent to viewing a 25 inch screen from roughly 8 feet away. Glass responds to natural voice commands to enable a hands free way to control the device.

        </p>
        <p class="right">
          The HoloLens is a head-mounted display, with a much more powerful processing system, that enables true augmented reality for the user. The user looks through tinted glass with projections on it, to create the augmented reality effect. HoloLens has 6 different cameras to that it can accurately track your motion and depth in your environment; it uses this data to project data/visualizations through its tinted visors. The HoloLens is great at handling tasks like voice recognition, gesture recognition, and spatial mapping, as it’s computing power is greater that the average laptop.

        </p>
        <p class="left" id="sec">
          Glass was more of static projected screen so that your eye could read data, or notifications. It was initially more meant as an informative display, that is attached to your glasses, but once Google release the Mirror AP, third party developers were really able to create more application for the device. Many new applications hit the app store for the Glass, for example there was real time language translation apps, and various social networks reworked for Glass. In addition, Glass served many other one of a kind health care applications, such as storing electronic medical records, capturing the user's retinal informal for eye doctors, and even assisting surgeons in training.

        </p>
        <p class="right">
          HoloLens, has put a big emphasis on industrial application, on its take of and augmented reality headset. The fact that the HoloLens can track movement, depth, and essentially map out a 3D space, this really opens up the possible applications. The Hololens can digitally embed tracked virtual objects in the real world visible via the headset. This means that 3D designers can view their models in say their office and walk around it. Another application, is repair work, rather than having a plumber come to your house, you get their video stream embedded into your field of vision, and they can point out what you need to do. Lastly, the HoloLens has one of kind gaming possibilities. Rather than being limited to a TV screen, the HoloLens captures data from your environment, to embed the game within environment.

          Google Glass  received a great deal of criticism and legislative action due to privacy and safety concerns. On January 15, 2015, Google announced that it would stop producing the Google Glass prototype. Costs began running too high, and development was beginning to slow down greatly as Google’s focus shifted to other aspects of virtual innovation.

        </p>
        <p class="right">
          Hololens is an ongoing project run by Microsoft in order to further develop the Augmented Reality field.  Because of the myriad of potential applications, it can be seen as a representation of where AR is going in the future. Microsoft is using Hololens as a medium to truly allow the AR market to take off and become a daily part of our lives. Although still in very minimal stages, Hololens has the potential to spur the creation of a plethora of different AR devices in our near future that help to improve our day- to - day lives. As of now, it's a 3000 dollar piece of equipment still in development.
