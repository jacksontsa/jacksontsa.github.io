            Augmented Reality (AR) works to blur the line between reality and imagination. AR takes what we experience in the real world, and enhances it using computer-generated environments. Using a variety of technological innovations such as haptic feedback, graphics, sounds, 3D camera tracking, and smells, AR takes things we can hear, see, smell, or feel and “augments” it in order to create a revolutionary new experience for those using it. </p><p>

Imagine, for a minute, that you are walking down the street with a pair of sunglasses on. However, these are not your typical prescription sunglasses.Instead, they are crammed with high-tech sensors and a computer that are working together at projecting various real-time information onto the glasses regarding your surroundings. You turn and look at a specific building, and your glasses project information regarding that building, and other buildings like it in the near vicinity. A small camera and a multitude of sensors work in unison to gain an artificial sense of “awareness” of your surroundings, so that your AR technology can provide you with live information about anything you look at, whether it be a wild animal, a house, or a street sign;  you don't have to work with AR, AR works with you

            Previously, AR tech has been limited to gaming, at least for mainstream audiences. Games such as Pokemon GO and Ingress have adopted this technology into smartphones, but ongoing research and development hints at broader applications.

          <h2>What is AR used for?</h2>
          <h3>Augmented Reality has the potential for a variety of uses.Although the first picture that comes to mind when thinking of AR is glasses, AR comes in a multiple forms. Rather than being an idealized product, we can look at it as a class of products-- all geared to helping make our lives easier.
