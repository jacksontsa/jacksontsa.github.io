          <h3> <strong>The truth is, we discovered long ago that when used correctly, AI can make our lives easier, but in order to take advantage of this, we need to take a look at what Artificial Intelligence IS. </strong></h3>

          <p id="med">
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence:  </strong>Artificial intelligence is the intelligence that a machine demonstrates unlike that of animals and humans. The machines are given jobs to do through programs created by humans to efficiently carry out actions that may be tedious for humans to sit through or quickly run through the data for businesses. What makes artificial intelligence so special is not only  regular computer programs is the machines’ ability to mimic human actions. 
          </p>
        
          <p id="med">
            <strong>Available Technology: </strong> Despite the immense potential AI proves to envision, the technology available currently only skims the surface of the ocean of possibility. The current use of AI is subtle, in systems such as speech recognition in smartphones with developing smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Samsung’s Bixby.
          </p>

          <h3>In terms of the raw principles surrounding Artificial Intelligence, current technology revolves around to basic ideas: Machine Learning and Neural Networks.</h3>
          <p id="med">

            <strong> Machine Learning: </strong>] Machine Learning currently exists as our most common form of AI application. Essentially what occurs in this process, is the use of basic AI principles such as learning and uncovering trends from large amounts of data. Think of a coin sorter, but one that sorts millions on trillions of coins, in mere minutes. </br></p>
          <p id="med">  
            <strong> Neural Networks: </strong>From a biological perspective, neural networks make up the backbone of our understanding of how the brain works on a daily basis, through learning. AI development has allowed this biological idea to be recreated on a virtual level, in a sense, mimicking the animal brain’s processes and improving upon it to create virtual systems that can essentially think for themselves. The advancement of neural networks has been a keystone facet in the development of rudimentary AI applications through machine learning, and has also been integrated into more complex systems such as Google’s DeepMind AI. Deep learning and its accompaniments also fall under the subset of machine learning, and create computers and virtual systems that are ever closer to being “human”. 
          </p>
          <p> This brings up the question, how "human" is too "human"?</p>

      Safety is an incredibly important aspect of Artificial Intelligence research and development, and not just for simple reasons. AI programming can have the usual risks where code malfunctions and causes harm as a result, but it can also pose safety issues on an existential level. Artificial Intelligence, as a whole, is built around the idea of creating virtual systems that have their own “cognition”. Now, this is where a huge issue is faced. When developing this cognition of an AI engine, a small mistake in the code can have potentially destructive impacts on the systems this AI works on, as well as on the real world it interacts with. An example of this is if an AI system is set to achieve a certain goal, but not given specifications on how to achieve this goal, and as a result of its developed virtual cognition chooses to take a relatively harmful path to achieving this goal set forth by the original creator. The cognition we create, is something that could get out of hand very quickly, and therefore it is vital that AI research and testing involves intensive analysis of the specific attributes an AI system is given to work with, particularly in “worst case scenarios”.

          <p>
            Another major issue that comes up is the ease of hacking on both a hardware and software level. AI systems from robots to online entities, could be programmed by hackers and those with malicious intent to wreak havoc at a much higher level of efficiency in comparison to a human. A study done by researchers at ZeroFox found that these forms of AI-based hackers had a much higher success rate at mass spreading phishing messages on social media platforms when compared to a human. Aritficial Intelligence comes with its own revolutionized form of hacking, and as a result one must strongly consider and research various forms of protection from these abuses of AI technology.

          Model Xythe is a concept built on the idea of “standing on the shoulders of giants”. And therefore its uses are based on the shoulders of one of the biggest sources of information in our world: the Internet. Model Xythe is intended to be a revolution in student and business lifestyles, and its uses are optimized exactly to make these people's’ lives easier. From reading out the day’s schedule in the morning, to taking average travel time data to provide the best route from point A to B on a given day of a given year. From acting as a security robot that immediately alerts you of any fishy business within milliseconds of it occurring near your premises, to analyzing the type of music you listen to in order to provide the ideal playlist for the given time of the day. From acting as a proxy for teachers to upload lectures to for those days where you just cannot get out of bed, to being your notekeeper for business activities. Xythe is the ultimate secretary, sibling, teacher, and assistant a student or CEO could ever need.

        The technology we used in the development of this ai robot was based on a simple principle: make it work. We took the baseline structural compositions of robots from companies like Hanson Robotics (creator of media robot star Sophia) to basic roombas, and ran it through the most powerful creativity machine in our world: humans. We plotted and examined the nuances within each of these types of robots based in artificial intelligence, no matter how simple or how complex, and used it to create efficient structures that can be effective and simply utilized for various tasks under one “brain”. </br>
        Not only do we plan on using AI based on optimized hardware, but Xythe comes with something that not many other robots can actively take advantage of: learning through conversation. Our robots are built to learn by conversing-- not only with owners and humans, but with other robots on a community/regional-based cloud network, where data from a simple weather forecast to a complex network of traffic times is shared, creating a collective base of knowledge that is constantly improving.

          Glass was more of static projected screen so that your eye could read data, or notifications. It was initially more meant as an informative display, that is attached to your glasses, but once Google release the Mirror AP, third party developers were really able to create more application for the device. Many new applications hit the app store for the Glass, for example there was real time language translation apps, and various social networks reworked for Glass. In addition, Glass served many other one of a kind health care applications, such as storing electronic medical records, capturing the user's retinal informal for eye doctors, and even assisting surgeons in training.

          HoloLens, has put a big emphasis on industrial application, on its take of and augmented reality headset. The fact that the HoloLens can track movement, depth, and essentially map out a 3D space, this really opens up the possible applications. The Hololens can digitally embed tracked virtual objects in the real world visible via the headset. This means that 3D designers can view their models in say their office and walk around it. Another application, is repair work, rather than having a plumber come to your house, you get their video stream embedded into your field of vision, and they can point out what you need to do. Lastly, the HoloLens has one of kind gaming possibilities. Rather than being limited to a TV screen, the HoloLens captures data from your environment, to embed the game within environment.

          Google Glass  received a great deal of criticism and legislative action due to privacy and safety concerns. On January 15, 2015, Google announced that it would stop producing the Google Glass prototype. Costs began running too high, and development was beginning to slow down greatly as Google’s focus shifted to other aspects of virtual innovation.

          Hololens is an ongoing project run by Microsoft in order to further develop the Augmented Reality field.  Because of the myriad of potential applications, it can be seen as a representation of where AR is going in the future. Microsoft is using Hololens as a medium to truly allow the AR market to take off and become a daily part of our lives. Although still in very minimal stages, Hololens has the potential to spur the creation of a plethora of different AR devices in our near future that help to improve our day- to - day lives. As of now, it's a 3000 dollar piece of equipment still in development.
